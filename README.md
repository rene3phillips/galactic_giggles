## My First Python Project

Welcome to my first-ever Python project! 
This repository is a milestone in my coding journey, showcasing my first step into programming with Python. ðŸŽ‰

## Project Overview

This project is a simple yet meaningful demonstration of foundational Python concepts. 
The primary goal of the project was to:

Practice Python basics

Build confidence with coding

Create something fun and functional

## Features

Madlibs Game: A fun and interactive game where users input words to complete a story.

User Input Validation: Ensures the game runs smoothly by validating inputs.

Replay Option: Players can replay the game with a new set of inputs.

## Technologies Used

Python

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/rene3phillips/galactic_giggles.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd galactic_giggles

Run the Python script:

python galactic_giggles.py

## What I Learned

Through this project, I gained experience in:

Writing Python scripts

Debugging and solving simple programming errors

Working with user input and string manipulation

## Next Steps

I plan to:

Learn more advanced Python concepts.

Explore projects involving APIs or data visualization.

Build something interactive like a game or a small web application.

## Acknowledgements

A big thank you to the Python community for creating amazing resources and tutorials.
